# Atomus

A theme based on the late Atom Editor.

This is a fork (duplicate) of [obsidian-atom](https://github.com/kognise/obsidian-atom) with some changes based on my opinion.

---

- The codeblock theme is based on [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme).
- New default accent color.
- Accent color can be changed.
- Graph View lines match the accent color but they're slightly darker.
- More discrete status bar.
- [Full Calendar Plugin](https://github.com/davish/obsidian-full-calendar) support (the events **will** match your accent color).
- And some other minor changes...
